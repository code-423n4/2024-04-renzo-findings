1. Some contracts miss the explicit initialization of inherited contracts. It does not cause any harm but it would be better to stay consistent:
`xRenzoBridge` -> `__ReentrancyGuard_init();`
`xRenzoDeposit` -> `__ReentrancyGuard_init();`
`WithdrawQueue` -> `__ReentrancyGuard_init`

2. The value of `coolDownPeriod` may change between the withdrawal initiation and claim. It would be more fair to cache this value in every withdrawal request:
```solidity
if (block.timestamp - _withdrawRequest.createdAt < coolDownPeriod) revert EarlyClaim();
```

3. When initializing `EzEthToken`, the name should come first and then the symbol:
```solidity
__ERC20_init("ezETH", "Renzo Restaked ETH");
```
```solidity
    function __ERC20_init(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) internal onlyInitializing {
        __ERC20_init_unchained(name_, symbol_);
    }
```
but the issue is fixed by overriding `name()` and `symbol()` functions later to return correct values.

4. This hardcoded address is used across different contracts. extract it to a separate `Constants` contract:
`address public constant IS_NATIVE = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;`

5. Could emit `OraclePriceFeedUpdated(oracle, address(0));`:
```solidity
// set oracle Price Feed struct
oracle = _oracle;
```

6. No need `nonReentrant` because only an event is emitted:
```solidity
function fillEthWithdrawBuffer() external payable nonReentrant onlyDepositQueue {
        emit EthBufferFilled(msg.value);
    }
```

7. When initiating the withdrawal it checks if the asset is supported:
```solidity
  // check if provided assetOut is supported
  if (withdrawalBufferTarget[_assetOut] == 0) revert UnsupportedWithdrawAsset();
```
It is not possible to disable withdrawal asset in `updateWithdrawBufferTarget`:
```solidity
  if (_newBufferTarget[i].asset == address(0) || _newBufferTarget[i].bufferAmount == 0)
                revert InvalidZeroInput();
```
If an asset misbehaves, an admin should be capable of disabling it.

8. Claim uses bad practices to push withdrawal assets to the user.
1) `.transfer` which is not recommended due to limited forwarded gas.
2) ERC20 transfer does not check the returned value (bool) indicating success.
```solidity
        // send selected redeem asset to user
        if (_withdrawRequest.collateralToken == IS_NATIVE) {
            payable(msg.sender).transfer(_withdrawRequest.amountToRedeem);
        } else {
            IERC20(_withdrawRequest.collateralToken).transfer(
                msg.sender,
                _withdrawRequest.amountToRedeem
            );
        }
```

9. I believe the withdrawal queue needs the possibility to cancel the withdrawal request and return ezETH to the user. Especially considering that `.transfer` might fail on some recipients.
