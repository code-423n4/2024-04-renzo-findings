**Solution**: Change the visibility specifier of the variable to `internal` or `protected`.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
abstract contract RenzoOracleL2StorageV1 is IRenzoOracleL2 {
    AggregatorV3Interface internal oracle;
}
```

[CCIPReceiver.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Bridge/L2/PriceFeed/CCIPReceiver.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. The `Ownable` and `Pausable` contracts are inherited but not used in the `Receiver` contract. Consider removing these unused inheritances to improve contract clarity and reduce the contract size.

**Solution**: Remove the unused `Ownable` and `Pausable` contract inheritances.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
contract Receiver is CCIPReceiver {
    // ...
}
```

[ConnextReceiver.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Bridge/L2/PriceFeed/ConnextReceiver.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. The `Ownable` and `Pausable` contracts are inherited but not used in the `ConnextReceiver` contract. Consider removing these unused inheritances to improve contract clarity and reduce the contract size.

[xRenzoDeposit.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Bridge/L2/xRenzoDeposit.sol):

Low Severity:

- 1. The `_trade` function does not check the return value of the `swapExact` function call. If the swap fails, the function will continue executing without reverting or handling the failure case. Consider adding a check to ensure the swap was successful.

**Solution**: Add a check for the return value of the `swapExact` function call and handle the failure case accordingly.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function _trade(uint256 _amountIn, uint256 _deadline) internal returns (uint256) {
    // ...
    uint256 amountNextWETH = connext.swapExact(
        swapKey,
        _amountIn,
        address(depositToken),
        address(collateralToken),
        minOut,

    /// @notice The last price that was updated - denominated in ETH with 18 decimal precision
    uint256 internal lastPrice;

    // ...
}
```

/// @dev Prevents implementation contract from being initialized.
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

[XERC20Factory.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Bridge/xERC20/contracts/XERC20Factory.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. The `constructor` is defined but not used in the contract. Consider removing the unused `constructor` to improve contract clarity and reduce the contract size.

**Solution**: Remove the unused `constructor`.

Code snippet of improvement: Remove the following lines:
```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

[XERC20Lockbox.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Bridge/xERC20/contracts/XERC20Lockbox.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. The `constructor` is defined but not used in the contract. Consider removing the unused `constructor` to improve contract clarity and reduce the contract size.

**Solution**: Remove the unused `constructor`.

Code snippet of improvement: Remove the following lines:
```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

[OptimismMintableXERC20.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Bridge/xERC20/contracts/optimism/OptimismMintableXERC20.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. The `constructor` is defined but not used in the contract. Consider removing the unused `constructor` to improve contract clarity and reduce the contract size.

**Solution**: Remove the unused `constructor`.

Code snippet of improvement: Remove the following lines:
```solidity
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

[OptimismMintableXERC20Factory.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Bridge/xERC20/contracts/optimism/OptimismMintableXERC20Factory.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. The `constructor` is defined but not used in the contract. Consider removing the unused `constructor` to improve contract clarity and reduce the contract size.

**Solution**: Remove the unused `constructor`.

Code snippet of improvement: Remove the following lines:
```solidity
/// @dev Prevents implementation contract from being initialized.
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

[OperatorDelegator.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Delegation/OperatorDelegator.sol):

Low Severity:

- 1. Missing input validation in `setDelegateAddress` function

The `setDelegateAddress` function allows setting the `delegateAddress` only once, but it does not validate the `_delegateAddress` input to ensure it is a valid, non-zero address. This could lead to accidentally setting an invalid delegate address.

**Solution**: Add a check to ensure `_delegateAddress` is not the zero address.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function setDelegateAddress(
    address _delegateAddress,
    ISignatureUtils.SignatureWithExpiry memory approverSignatureAndExpiry,
    bytes32 approverSalt
) external nonReentrant onlyOperatorDelegatorAdmin {
    if (_delegateAddress == address(0)) revert InvalidZeroInput();
    if (address(delegateAddress) != address(0x0)) revert DelegateAddressAlreadySet();
    // ...
}
```

- 2. Unbounded loop in `completeQueuedWithdrawal` function

The `completeQueuedWithdrawal` function has an unbounded loop that iterates over `tokens` and `withdrawal.shares` arrays. For large arrays, this could exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to revert.

**Solution**: Consider using a pagination approach or limit the maximum size of the input arrays.

- 3. Lack of access control on `queueWithdrawals` function

The `queueWithdrawals` function allows queuing withdrawals from the EigenLayer without any access control. This could allow any user to queue withdrawals on behalf of the contract.

**Solution**: Add appropriate access control, such as an `onlyRestakeManagerAdmin` modifier, to restrict access to authorized addresses only.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function queueWithdrawals(
    IERC20[] calldata tokens,
    uint256[] calldata tokenAmounts
) external nonReentrant onlyRestakeManagerAdmin returns (bytes32) {
    // ...
}
```

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of named return variables

Some functions, like `getTokenBalanceFromStrategy`, use named return variables while others don't. Consistent use of named return variables can improve code readability.

**Solution**: Consider using named return variables consistently throughout the contract.

- 2. Redundant zero-address checks

The `initialize` function checks for zero-addresses for input parameters, but some of these checks are redundant since they are already performed in the `setDelegateAddress` and `setBaseGasAmountSpent` functions.

**Solution**: Remove the redundant zero-address checks from the `initialize` function.

- 3. Missing emit statement for `BaseGasAmountSpentUpdated` event

The `setBaseGasAmountSpent` function updates the `baseGasAmountSpent` variable but does not emit the corresponding `BaseGasAmountSpentUpdated` event.

**Solution**: Add the missing emit statement after updating the `baseGasAmountSpent` variable.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function setBaseGasAmountSpent(
    uint256 _baseGasAmountSpent
) external nonReentrant onlyOperatorDelegatorAdmin {
    if (_baseGasAmountSpent == 0) revert InvalidZeroInput();
    emit BaseGasAmountSpentUpdated(baseGasAmountSpent, _baseGasAmountSpent);
    baseGasAmountSpent = _baseGasAmountSpent;
}
```

[OperatorDelegatorStorage.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Delegation/OperatorDelegatorStorage.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of visibility specifiers

The `OperatorDelegatorStorageV1`, `OperatorDelegatorStorageV2`, `OperatorDelegatorStorageV3`, and `OperatorDelegatorStorageV4` contracts are declared as `abstract`, but their variables are declared as `public`. For consistency, consider changing the visibility specifier to `internal` or `protected`.

**Solution**: Change the visibility specifier of the variables to `internal` or `protected`.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
abstract contract OperatorDelegatorStorageV1 is IOperatorDelegator {
    /// @dev reference to the RoleManager contract
    IRoleManager internal roleManager;

    /// @dev The main strategy manager contract in EigenLayer
    IStrategyManager internal strategyManager;

    // ...
}
```

[DepositQueue.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Deposits/DepositQueue.sol):

Low Severity:

- 1. Unbounded loop in `stakeEthFromQueueMulti` function

The `stakeEthFromQueueMulti` function has an unbounded loop that iterates over the input arrays. For large arrays, this could exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to revert.

**Solution**: Consider using a pagination approach or limit the maximum size of the input arrays.

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of named return variables

The `getBufferDeficit` function in the `withdrawQueue` contract uses a named return variable, while other functions in the `DepositQueue` contract don't. Consistent use of named return variables can improve code readability.

**Solution**: Consider using named return variables consistently throughout the contract.

- 2. Redundant zero-address checks

The `initialize` function checks for zero-addresses for input parameters, but these checks are redundant since they are already performed in the `setRestakeManager` and `setWithdrawQueue` functions.

**Solution**: Remove the redundant zero-address checks from the `initialize` function.

[WBETHShim.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Oracle/Binance/WBETHShim.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Redundant zero-address check

The `initialize` function checks for a zero-address for the `_wBETHToken` parameter, but this check is already performed in the constructor.

**Solution**: Remove the redundant zero-address check from the `initialize` function.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function initialize(IStakedTokenV2 _wBETHToken) public initializer {
    // Removed redundant zero-address check
    // if (address(_wBETHToken) == address(0x0)) revert InvalidZeroInput();

    wBETHToken = _wBETHToken;
}
```

[WBETHShimStorage.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Oracle/Binance/WBETHShimStorage.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of visibility specifiers

The `WBETHShimStorageV1` contract is declared as `abstract`, but its variable is declared as `public`. For consistency, consider changing the visibility specifier to `internal` or `protected`.

**Solution**: Change the visibility specifier of the variable to `internal` or `protected`.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
abstract contract WBETHShimStorageV1 is AggregatorV3Interface {
    IStakedTokenV2 internal wBETHToken;
}
```

[METHShim.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Oracle/Mantle/METHShim.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Redundant zero-address check

The `initialize` function checks for a zero-address for the `_methStaking` parameter, but this check is already performed in the constructor.

**Solution**: Remove the redundant zero-address check from the `initialize` function.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function initialize(IMethStaking _methStaking) public initializer {
    // Removed redundant zero-address check
    // if (address(_methStaking) == address(0x0)) revert InvalidZeroInput();

    methStaking = _methStaking;
}
```

[METHShimStorage.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Oracle/Mantle/METHShimStorage.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of visibility specifiers

The `METHShimStorageV1` contract is declared as `abstract`, but its variable is declared as `public`. For consistency, consider changing the visibility specifier to `internal` or `protected`.

**Solution**: Change the visibility specifier of the variable to `internal` or `protected`.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
abstract contract METHShimStorageV1 is AggregatorV3Interface {
    IMethStaking internal methStaking;
}
```

[RenzoOracle.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Oracle/RenzoOracle.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Redundant zero-address check

The `initialize` function checks for a zero-address for the `_roleManager` parameter, but this check is already performed in the `onlyOracleAdmin` modifier.

**Solution**: Remove the redundant zero-address check from the `initialize` function.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function initialize(IRoleManager _roleManager) public initializer {
    // Removed redundant zero-address check
    // if (address(_roleManager) == address(0x0)) revert InvalidZeroInput();
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();
    roleManager = _roleManager;
}
```

- 2. Inconsistent use of named return variables

The `lookupTokenValue` function uses a named return variable, while other functions don't. Consistent use of named return variables can improve code readability.

**Solution**: Consider using named return variables consistently throughout the contract.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function lookupTokenValue(IERC20 _token, uint256 _balance) public view returns (uint256 tokenValue) {
    AggregatorV3Interface oracle = tokenOracleLookup[_token];
    if (address(oracle) == address(0x0)) revert OracleNotFound();

    (, int256 price, , uint256 timestamp, ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
    if (timestamp < block.timestamp - MAX_TIME_WINDOW) revert OraclePriceExpired();
    if (price <= 0) revert InvalidOraclePrice();
    tokenValue = (uint256(price) * _balance) / SCALE_FACTOR;
}
```

[RenzoOracleStorage.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Oracle/RenzoOracleStorage.sol):

- 1. Inconsistent use of visibility specifiers

The `RenzoOracleStorageV1` contract is declared as `abstract`, but its variables are declared as `public`. For consistency, consider changing the visibility specifier to `internal` or `protected`.

**Solution**: Change the visibility specifier of the variables to `internal` or `protected`.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
abstract contract RenzoOracleStorageV1 {
    IRoleManager internal roleManager;
    mapping(IERC20 => AggregatorV3Interface) internal tokenOracleLookup;
}
```

[RoleManagerStorage.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Permissions/RoleManagerStorage.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of visibility specifiers

The `RoleManagerStorageV1`, `RoleManagerStorageV2`, and `RoleManagerStorageV3` contracts declare their constants as `public`. Consider changing the visibility specifier to `internal` for consistency with other storage contracts.

**Solution**: Change the visibility specifier of the constants to `internal`.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
contract RoleManagerStorageV1 {
    bytes32 internal constant RX_ETH_MINTER_BURNER = keccak256("RX_ETH_MINTER_BURNER");
    bytes32 internal constant OPERATOR_DELEGATOR_ADMIN = keccak256("OPERATOR_DELEGATOR_ADMIN");
    bytes32 internal constant ORACLE_ADMIN = keccak256("ORACLE_ADMIN");
    bytes32 internal constant RESTAKE_MANAGER_ADMIN = keccak256("RESTAKE_MANAGER_ADMIN");
    bytes32 internal constant TOKEN_ADMIN = keccak256("TOKEN_ADMIN");
    bytes32 internal constant NATIVE_ETH_RESTAKE_ADMIN = keccak256("NATIVE_ETH_RESTAKE_ADMIN");
    bytes32 internal constant ERC20_REWARD_ADMIN = keccak256("ERC20_REWARD_ADMIN");
    bytes32 internal constant DEPOSIT_WITHDRAW_PAUSER = keccak256("DEPOSIT_WITHDRAW_PAUSER");
}
```

[BalancerRateProvider.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/RateProvider/BalancerRateProvider.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Redundant zero-address checks

The `initialize` function checks for zero-addresses for input parameters, but these checks are redundant since they are already performed in the constructor.

**Solution**: Remove the redundant zero-address checks from the `initialize` function.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function initialize(
    IRestakeManager _restakeManager,
    IERC20Upgradeable _ezETHToken
) public initializer {
    // Removed redundant zero-address checks
    // if (address(_restakeManager) == address(0x0)) revert InvalidZeroInput();
    // if (address(_ezETHToken) == address(0x0)) revert InvalidZeroInput();

    restakeManager = _restakeManager;
    ezETHToken = _ezETHToken;
}
```

[BalancerRateProviderStorage.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/RateProvider/BalancerRateProviderStorage.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of visibility specifiers

The `BalancerRateProviderStorageV1` contract is declared as `abstract`, but its variables are declared as `public`. For consistency, consider changing the visibility specifier to `internal` or `protected`.

**Solution**: Change the visibility specifier of the variables to `internal` or `protected`.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
abstract contract BalancerRateProviderStorageV1 {
    /// @dev reference to the RestakeManager contract
    IRestakeManager internal restakeManager;

    /// @dev reference to the ezETH token contract
    IERC20Upgradeable internal ezETHToken;
}
```

[RestakeManager.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/RestakeManager.sol):

Low Severity:

- 1. Unbounded loops in `addOperatorDelegator`, `removeOperatorDelegator`, and `calculateTVLs` functions

These functions contain unbounded loops that iterate over arrays. For large arrays, this could exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to revert.

**Solution**: Consider using a pagination approach or limit the maximum size of the input arrays.

- 2. Inconsistent use of `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom`

The `deposit` and `depositTokenRewardsFromProtocol` functions use `safeTransferFrom` to transfer tokens, while the `sweepERC20` function in the `DepositQueue` contract uses `safeTransfer`. Inconsistent use of these functions could lead to unexpected behavior.

**Solution**: Use `safeTransfer` consistently for token transfers within the protocol, and use `safeTransferFrom` for transfers from external addresses.

Non-Critical:

- 1. Redundant zero-address checks

The `initialize` function checks for zero-addresses for input parameters, but these checks are redundant since they are already performed in the respective setter functions.

**Solution**: Remove the redundant zero-address checks from the `initialize` function.

- 2. Inconsistent use of named return variables

Some functions, like `calculateTVLs`, use named return variables while others don't. Consistent use of named return variables can improve code readability.

**Solution**: Consider using named return variables consistently throughout the contract.

- 3. Duplicate code in `chooseOperatorDelegatorForDeposit` and `chooseOperatorDelegatorForWithdraw` functions

These functions have similar logic for choosing an operator delegator. The duplicate code could be refactored into a separate internal function to improve maintainability.

**Solution**: Refactor the common logic into a separate internal function and call it from both functions.

[RestakeManagerStorage.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/RestakeManagerStorage.sol):

Low Severity:

- 1. Redundant storage variables

The `RestakeManagerStorageV1` contract declares storage variables for `strategyManager` and `delegationManager`, but these variables are not used anywhere in the contract or its inheriting contracts. Removing unused storage variables can help reduce contract size and improve clarity.

**Solution**: Remove the unused `strategyManager` and `delegationManager` storage variables.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
abstract contract RestakeManagerStorageV1 is IRestakeManager {
    /// @dev reference to the RoleManager contract
    IRoleManager public roleManager;

    /// @dev reference to the ezETH token contract
    IEzEthToken public ezETH;

    // Removed unused storage variables
    // IStrategyManager public strategyManager;
    // IDelegationManager public delegationManager;

    // ...
}
```

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent naming convention

The `RestakeManagerStorageV1` contract uses a mix of snake_case and camelCase for variable and struct names. Consistent naming conventions can improve code readability and maintainability.

**Solution**: Use a consistent naming convention throughout the contract, preferably camelCase for variable and struct names.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
abstract contract RestakeManagerStorageV1 is IRestakeManager {
    // ...

    /// @dev data stored for a withdrawal
    struct PendingWithdrawal {
        uint256 ezEthToBurn;
        address withdrawer;
        IERC20 tokenToWithdraw;
        uint256 tokenAmountToWithdraw;
        IOperatorDelegator operatorDelegator;
        bool completed;
    }

    /// @dev mapping of pending withdrawals, indexed by the withdrawal root from EigenLayer
    mapping(bytes32 => PendingWithdrawal) public pendingWithdrawals;

    // ...

[RewardHandler.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Rewards/RewardHandler.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Redundant zero-address checks

The `initialize` function checks for zero-addresses for input parameters, but the `setRewardDestination` function already performs this check when updating the `rewardDestination` variable.

**Solution**: Remove the redundant zero-address check for `_rewardDestination` from the `initialize` function.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function initialize(IRoleManager _roleManager, address _rewardDestination) public initializer {
    __ReentrancyGuard_init();

    if (address(_roleManager) == address(0x0)) revert InvalidZeroInput();
    // Removed redundant zero-address check
    // if (address(_rewardDestination) == address(0x0)) revert InvalidZeroInput();

    roleManager = _roleManager;
    rewardDestination = _rewardDestination;

    emit RewardDestinationUpdated(_rewardDestination);
}
```

- 2. Inconsistent use of named return variables

The `forwardRewards` function uses a named return variable for the `gasBefore` parameter, while the `_forwardETH` function doesn't. Consistent use of named return variables can improve code readability.

**Solution**: Consider removing the named return variable from the `forwardRewards` function for consistency.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function forwardRewards() external nonReentrant onlyNativeEthRestakeAdmin {
    // Removed named return variable
    // uint256 gasBefore = gasleft();
    _forwardETH();
}
```

[TimelockController.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/TimelockController.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Unused import statements

The contract imports `IERC721Receiver` and `IERC1155Receiver` interfaces, but the contract does not use them directly. The only usage is in the `supportsInterface` function, which can be removed if the contract does not need to support these interfaces.

**Solution**: Remove the unused import statements and the corresponding `supportsInterface` function if not needed.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
// Removed unused import statements
// import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721Receiver.sol";
// import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/IERC1155Receiver.sol";

contract TimelockController is AccessControl {
    // ...

    // Removed supportsInterface function
    // function supportsInterface(
    //     bytes4 interfaceId
    // ) public view virtual override(IERC165, AccessControl) returns (bool) {
    //     return
    //         interfaceId == type(IERC1155Receiver).interfaceId ||
    //         super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    // }

    // ...
}
```

[WithdrawQueue.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/Withdraw/WithdrawQueue.sol):

Low Severity:

- 1. Unbounded loop in `updateWithdrawBufferTarget` function

The `updateWithdrawBufferTarget` function has an unbounded loop that iterates over the `_newBufferTarget` array. For large arrays, this could exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to revert.

**Solution**: Consider using a pagination approach or limit the maximum size of the input array.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function updateWithdrawBufferTarget(
    TokenWithdrawBuffer[] calldata _newBufferTarget,
    uint256 offset,
    uint256 limit
) external onlyWithdrawQueueAdmin {
    if (_newBufferTarget.length == 0) revert InvalidZeroInput();
    for (uint256 i = offset; i < offset + limit && i < _newBufferTarget.length; i++) {
        if (_newBufferTarget[i].asset == address(0) || _newBufferTarget[i].bufferAmount == 0)
            revert InvalidZeroInput();
        emit WithdrawBufferTargetUpdated(
            withdrawalBufferTarget[_newBufferTarget[i].asset],
            _newBufferTarget[i].bufferAmount
        );
        withdrawalBufferTarget[_newBufferTarget[i].asset] = _newBufferTarget[i].bufferAmount;
    }
}
```

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of named return variables

The `getAvailableToWithdraw` and `getBufferDeficit` functions use named return variables, while other functions don't. Consistent use of named return variables can improve code readability.

**Solution**: Consider using named return variables consistently throughout the contract.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function getAvailableToWithdraw(address _asset) public view returns (uint256 availableToWithdraw) {
    if (_asset != IS_NATIVE) {
        availableToWithdraw = IERC20(_asset).balanceOf(address(this)) - claimReserve[_asset];
    } else {
        availableToWithdraw = address(this).balance - claimReserve[_asset];
    }
}

function getBufferDeficit(address _asset) public view returns (uint256 bufferDeficit) {
    uint256 availableToWithdraw = getAvailableToWithdraw(_asset);
    bufferDeficit = withdrawalBufferTarget[_asset] > availableToWithdraw
        ? withdrawalBufferTarget[_asset] - availableToWithdraw
        : 0;
}
```

[EzEthToken.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-renzo/blob/main/contracts/token/EzEthToken.sol):

Non-Critical:

- 1. Inconsistent use of visibility specifiers

The `name` and `symbol` functions have a `public` visibility specifier, while the overridden functions in the `ERC20Upgradeable` contract have an `external` visibility specifier. Consistent use of visibility specifiers can improve code readability and reduce confusion.

**Solution**: Use the `external` visibility specifier for the `name` and `symbol` functions to match the overridden functions in the parent contract.

Code snippet of improvement:
```solidity
function name() external view virtual override returns (string memory) {
    return "Renzo Restaked ETH";
}

function symbol() external view virtual override returns (string memory) {
    return "ezETH";
}
```
